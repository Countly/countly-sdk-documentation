    <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">React Native Bridge is a successor to the React Native SDK</span></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The React Native SDK, which was developed earlier, will soon be end-of-life
    and will no longer be maintained.
    <span class="wysiwyg-color-black">Please use this bridge SDK for a more complete and tested version</span>.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">This is the Countly SDK for React Native applications. It features bridging, meaning it includes all the functionalities that Android and iOS SDKs provide rather than having those functionalities as React Native code.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400"><strong>Supported Platforms:</strong>&nbsp;Countly SDK supports iOS and Android.<br></span>
</p>
<p>
  You can take a look at our sample application in the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-react-native-bridge/tree/master/example" target="_self" rel="undefined">Github repo</a>.
  It should show how most of the functionalities can be used.
</p>
<h1>Adding the SDK to the project</h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">In order to use the React Native SDK, please use the following commands to create a new React Native application.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="shell">npm install -g react-native-cli     # Install React Native
react-native init AwesomeProject    # Create a new project

cd AwesomeProject                   # Go to that directory
react-native run-android # OR       # Run the android project
react-native run-ios                # Run the iOS project

# New terminal
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081       # Link Android port
npm start                           # Run the build server</code></pre>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">Run the following snippet in the root directory of your React Native project to install the npm dependencies and link&nbsp;</span><strong>native libraries</strong><span style="font-weight:400">.<br><strong>Note: </strong>use the latest SDK version currently available, not specifically the one shown in the sample below.</span>
</p>
<pre># Include the Countly Class in the file that you want to use.<br>npm install --save https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-react-native-bridge.git<br># OR <br>npm install --save countly-sdk-react-native-bridge@20.11.0<br><br># Linking the library to your app<br><br># react-native &lt; 0.60. For both Android and iOS<br>react-native link countly-sdk-react-native-bridge<br>cd node_modules/countly-sdk-react-native-bridge/ios/<br>pod install <br>cd ../../../<br><br># react-native &gt;= 0.60 for iOS (Android will autolink)<br>cd ios <br>pod install<br>cd ..</pre>
<h1>SDK Integration</h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">We will need to call two methods (<code>init</code> and <code>start</code>) in order to set up our SDK. You may also like to specify other parameters at this step (i.e. whether logging will be used). These methods should only be called once during the app's lifecycle and should be done as early as possible. Your main app component's <code>componentDidMount</code>method may be a good place.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">import Countly from 'countly-sdk-react-native-bridge';

if(!await Countly.isInitialized()) {
Countly.setLoggingEnabled(true); // Enable countly internal debugging logs
Countly.enableCrashReporting(); // Enable crash reporting to report unhandled crashes to Countly
Countly.setRequiresConsent(true); // Set that consent should be required for features to work.
Countly.giveConsentInit(["location", "sessions", "attribution", "push", "events", "views", "crashes", "users", "push", "star-rating", "apm", "feedback", "remote-config"]); // give conset for specific features before init.
Countly.setLocationInit("TR", "Istanbul", "41.0082,28.9784", "10.2.33.12"); // Set user initial location.

await Countly.init("https://try.count.ly", "YOUR_APP_KEY"); // Initialize the countly SDK.
Countly.start(); // start session tracking
}</code></pre>
<p>
  <span class="wysiwyg-color-black" style="font-weight:400">After <code>init</code> and <code>start</code> have been called once, you may use the commands in the rest of this document to send additional data and metrics to your server.</span>
</p>
<p><strong>Providing the application key</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Also called "appKey" as shorthand. The application key is used to identify for which application this information is tracked. You receive this value by creating a new application in your Countly dashboard and accessing it in its application management screen.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Ensure you are using the App Key (found under Management -&gt; Applications) and not the API Key. Entering the API Key will not work.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Providing the server URL</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If you are using Countly Enterprise Edition trial servers, use&nbsp;<code>https://try.count.ly</code>,&nbsp;<code>https://us-try.count.ly</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>https://asia-try.count.ly</code>&nbsp;It is basically the domain from which you are accessing your trial dashboard.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If you use both Community Edition and Enterprise Edition, use your own domain name or IP address, such as&nbsp;</span><a href="https://example.com/"><span>https://example.com</span></a><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><a href="https://ip/"><span>https://IP</span></a><span>&nbsp;(if SSL has been set up).</span>
</p>
<h2>Enable logging</h2>
<p>
  <span>The first thing you should do while integrating our SDK is enable logging. If logging is enabled, then our SDK will print out debug messages about its internal state and encountered problems.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Call&nbsp;<code>setLoggingEnabled</code>&nbsp;on the config class to enable logging:
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs coffeescript">Countly.setLoggingEnabled(true); // Enable countly internal debugging logs</code></pre>
<h2>Device ID</h2>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400"><span>You may provide your own custom device ID when</span> initializing the SDK using the method below.</span>
</p>
<pre>Countly.<span>init</span>(<span>SERVER_URL</span>, <span>APP_KEY, DEVICE_ID</span>)</pre>
<h2 class="anchor-heading">SDK data storage</h2>
<p>
  For iOS: SDK data is stored in Application Support Directory in file named "<span>Countly.dat</span>"&nbsp;<br>
  For Android: SDK data is stored in
  <span>SharedPreferences. A SharedPreferences object points to a file containing key-value pairs and provides simple methods to read and write them.</span>
</p>
<h1>Crash reporting</h1>
<p>
  <span>The Countly SDK has the ability to collect </span><a href="http://resources.count.ly/docs/introduction-to-crash-reporting-and-analytics"><span>crash reports</span></a><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;which you may examine and resolve later on the server.</span>
</p>
<h2>Automatic crash handling</h2>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">With this feature, the Countly SDK will generate a crash report if your application crashes due to an exception and send it to the Countly server for further inspection.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">If a crash report cannot be delivered to the server (e.g. no internet connection, unavailable server, etc.), then the SDK stores the crash report locally in order to try again at a later time.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">You will need to call the following method before calling <code>init</code> in order to activate automatic crash reporting.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">// Using Countly crash reports
Countly.enableCrashReporting();<br>Countly.init(...);</code></pre>
<h2>Automatic crash report segmentation</h2>
<p>
  <span>You may add a key/value segment to crash reports. For example, you could set which specific library or framework version you used in your app. You may then figure out if there is any correlation between the specific library or another segment and the crash reports.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Use the following function for this purpose:</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">var segment = {"Key": "Value"};<br>Countly.setCustomCrashSegments(segment);</code></pre>
<h2>Handled exceptions</h2>
<p>
  <span>You might catch an exception or similar error during your appâ€™s runtime.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>You may also log these handled exceptions to monitor how and when they are happening with the following command:</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">Countly.logException(stack, nonfatal, customSegments);</code></pre>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">The method <code class="javascript">logException</code>takes a string for the stack trace, a boolean flag indicating if the crash is considered fatal or not, and a segments dictionary to add additional data to your crash report.</span>
</p>
<h2>Crash breadcrumbs</h2>
<p>
  Throughout your app you can leave&nbsp;crash breadcrumbs which would describe
  previous steps that were taken in your app before the crash. After a crash happens,
  they will be sent together with the crash report.
</p>
<p>Following the command adds crash breadcrumb:</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">Countly.addCrashLog(String record) </code></pre>
<h2>Native C++ Crash Reporting</h2>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">If you have C++ libraries in your Android app, the React Native Bridge SDK allows you to record possible crashes in your Countly server by integrating the <code>sdk-native</code></span><span style="font-weight:400">developed within our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-android"><span style="font-weight:400">Android SDK</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">. F</span><span style="font-weight:400">ind more information <a href="https://support.count.ly/hc/en-us/articles/360037754031-Android-SDK#native-c-crash-reporting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">As this feature is optional, you will need to uncomment some parts in our SDK files in order to make it available. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">1. Go to <code>android/build.gradle</code></span><span style="font-weight:400">and add the package dependency (all file paths in this section are given relative to the <code>countly-sdk-react-native-bridge</code></span><span style="font-weight:400">which was <code>npm</code></span><span style="font-weight:400">installed above):</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="shell">dependencies {
    implementation 'ly.count.android:sdk-native:19.02.3'    
}</code></pre>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">2. Uncomment the following in the <code>android/src/main/java/ly/count/android/sdk/react/CountlyReactNative.java</code></span><span style="font-weight:400">file:</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="java">import ly.count.android.sdknative.CountlyNative;
    
@ReactMethod
  public void initNative(){
  CountlyNative.initNative(getReactApplicationContext());
}
	
@ReactMethod
  public void testCrash(){
  CountlyNative.crash();
}
    </code></pre>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">3. Modify <code>Countly.js</code></span><span style="font-weight:400">to connect from JavaScript to these new methods:</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">Countly.initNative = function(){
    CountlyReactNative.initNative();
}

Countly.testCrash = function(){
    CountlyReactNative.testCrash();
}</code></pre>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">If you are using our sample app in <code>example/App.js</code></span><span style="font-weight:400">,</span><span style="font-weight:400"> also uncomment the following parts in it for easy testing:</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">initNative(){
  Countly.initNative();
};

testCrash(){
  Countly.testCrash();
}

// ...

            &lt; Button onPress = { this.initNative } title = "Init Native" color = "#00b5ad"&gt; 
            &lt; Button onPress = { this.testCrash } title = "Test Native Crash" color = "crimson"&gt; 

</code></pre>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">We suggest calling <code>Countly.initNative()</code></span><span style="font-weight:400"> as soon as your app is initialized to be able to catch setup time crashes. Sending crash dump files to the server will be taken care of by the Android SDK during the next app initialization. We also provide a Gradle plugin that automatically uploads symbol files to your server (these are needed for the symbolication of crash dumps). Integrate it into your React Native project as explained in the relevant Android documentation </span><a href="https://resources.count.ly/docs/countly-sdk-for-android#section-native-c-crash-reporting"><span style="font-weight:400">page</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">This is what the debug logs will look like if you use this feature:</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="text">$ adb logcat -s Countly:V countly_breakpad_cpp:V

# when Countly.initNative() is called 

D/countly_breakpad_cpp(123): breakpad initialize succeeded. dump files will be saved at /Countly/CrashDumps

<h1>Custom Events</h1>
<h2>Setting up custom events</h2>
<p>
  <span>A&nbsp;</span><a href="http://resources.count.ly/docs/custom-events"><span>custom event</span></a><span> is any type of action that you can send to a Countly instance, e.g. purchases, changed settings, view enabled, and so on. This way it's possible to get much more information from your application compared to what is sent from the SDK to the Countly instance by default.</span>
</p>
<div class="callout callout--warning">
  <p class="callout__title">
    <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Data passed should be in UTF-8</span></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    All data passed to the Countly server via the SDK or API should be in UTF-8.
  </p>
</div>
<h2>Segmentation</h2>
<p>
  When providing segmentation for events, the only valid data types are: "String",
  "Integer", "Double" and "Boolean". All other types will be ignored.
</p>
<h2>Custom event usage examples</h2>
<p>
  <span>We have provided an example of recording a&nbsp;</span><strong>purchase</strong><span>&nbsp;event below. Here is a quick summary of the information with which each usage will provide us:</span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Usage 1: how many times the&nbsp;<strong>purchase</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>event
    occurred.
  </li>
  <li>
    Usage 2: how many times the&nbsp;<strong>purchase</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>event
    occurred + the total amount of those purchases.
  </li>
  <li>
    Usage 3: how many times the&nbsp;<strong>purchase</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>event
    occurred +<span>&nbsp;</span><span>from which countries and application versions those purchases were made.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Usage 4: how many times the&nbsp;<strong>purchase</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>event
    occurred +&nbsp;<span>the total amount, both of which are also available, segmented into countries and application versions.</span><span></span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>1. Event key and count</strong>
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">var event = {"eventName":"Purchase","eventCount":1};<br>Countly.sendEvent(event);</code></pre>
<p>
  <strong>2. Event key, count, and sum</strong>
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">var event = {"eventName":"Purchase","eventCount":1,"eventSum":"0.99"};<br>Countly.sendEvent(event);</code></pre>
<p>
  <strong>3. Event key and count with segmentation(s)</strong>
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">var event = {"eventName":"<span class="hljs-string">purchase</span>","eventCount":1}; <br>event.segments = {"Country" : "Germany", "<span class="hljs-string">app_version</span>" : "1.0"}; <br>Countly.sendEvent(event);</code></pre>
<p>
  <strong>4. Event key, count, and sum with segmentation(s)</strong>
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">var event = {"eventName":"purchase","eventCount":1};<br>event.segments = {"Country" : "Germany", "app_version" : "1.0","eventSum":"0.99"};<br>Countly.sendEvent(event);</code></pre>
<p>
  <span>Those are only a few examples of what you can do with custom events. You may extend those examples and use Country, app_version, game_level, time_of_day, and any other segmentation that will provide you with valuable insights.</span>
</p>
<h2>Timed events</h2>
<p>
  <span>It's possible to create timed events by defining a start and a stop moment.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">String eventName = <span class="hljs-string">"Custom event"</span>;

<span class="hljs-comment">//start some event</span>
Countly.startEvent(eventName);
<span class="hljs-comment">//wait some time</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">//end the event </span>
Countly.endEvent(eventName);</code></pre>
<p>
  <span>You may also provide additional information when ending an event. However, in that case, you have to provide the segmentation, count, and sum. The default values for those are "null", 1 and 0.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">String eventName = <span class="hljs-string">"Custom event"</span>;

<span class="hljs-comment">//start some event</span>
Countly.startEvent(eventName);<br><br>var event = { "eventName": eventName, "eventCount": 1, "eventSum": "0.99" };<br>event.segments = { "Country": "Germany", "Age": "28" };<span class="hljs-comment"><br><br></span><span class="hljs-comment">//end the event while also providing segmentation information, count and sum</span>
Countly.endEvent(<span class="hljs-comment">event</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>
  You may cancel the started timed event in case it is not relevant anymore:
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">String eventName = <span class="hljs-string">"Event name"</span>;

<span class="hljs-comment">//start some event</span>
Countly.startEvent(eventName);
<span class="hljs-comment">//wait some time</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">//cancel the event </span>
Countly.cancelEvent(eventName);</code></pre>
<h1>View tracking</h1>
<p>
  <span>You may track custom views with the following code snippet:</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">Countly.recordView("View Name")</code></pre>
<p>
  While manually tracking views, you may add your custom segmentation to them like
  this:
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">var viewSegmentation = { "Country": "Germany", "Age": "28" };<br>Countly.recordView("View Name", viewSegmentation);</code></pre>
<p>
  <span>To review the resulting data, open the dashboard and go to</span><span>&nbsp;<code>Analytics &gt; Views</code></span><span>. For more information on how to use view tracking data to its fullest potential, click&nbsp;</span><a href="http://resources.count.ly/docs/view-analytics"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span>
</p>
<div class="img-container">
  <img src="https://count.ly/images/guide/1059a04-3.PNG">
</div>
<h1>Device ID management</h1>
<p>
  When the SDK is initialized the first time and no custom device ID is provided,
  a random one will be generated. For most use cases that is enough as it provides
  a random identity to one of your apps users.<span style="font-weight:400"><span></span></span><span style="font-weight:400"><span></span></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400"><span>For iOS: the device ID generated by the SDK is the Identifier For Vendor (IDFV).<br>For Android:&nbsp; the device ID generated by the SDK is the OpenUDID or Google Advertising ID.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
  To solve other potential use cases, we provide 3 ways to handle your device id:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changing device ID with merge</li>
  <li>Changing device ID without merge</li>
  <li>Using a temporary ID</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changing device ID with and without merge</h2>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">You may configure or change the device ID anytime using the method below.<br></span>
</p>
<pre>Countly.<span>changeDeviceId</span>(DEVICE_ID, <span>ON_SERVER</span>);</pre>
<p>
  <span>You may either allow the device to be counted as a new device or merge existing data on the server. </span>If
  <code>onServer</code> is set to <code>true</code>,
  <span>the old device ID on the server will be replaced with the new one, and data associated with the old device ID will be merged automatically.<br>Otherwise, if&nbsp;<code>onServer</code> is&nbsp;set to <code>false</code>, the device will be counted as a new device on the server.<br></span>
</p>
<h2>Temporary Device ID</h2>
<p>
  You may use a temporary device ID mode for keeping all requests on hold until
  the real device ID is set later.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  To enable this
  <span style="font-weight:400">when initializing the SDK, use the method below.</span>
</p>
<pre>Countly.<span>init</span>(<span>SERVER_URL</span>, <span>APP_KEY, "TemporaryDeviceID"</span>)</pre>
<p>
  To enable a temporary device ID <strong>after</strong> initialization, use the
  method below.
</p>
<pre>Countly.<span>changeDeviceId</span>(Countly."TemporaryDeviceID", <span>ON_SERVER</span>);</pre>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> When passing the<span> </span><code>TemporaryDeviceID</code><span>&nbsp;</span>for
  the<span>&nbsp;</span><code>deviceID</code><span>&nbsp;</span>parameter, the
  argument for the <code>onServer</code>parameter does not matter.
</p>
<p>
  As long as the device ID value is<span> </span><code>TemporaryDeviceID</code>,
  the SDK will be in temporary device ID mode and all requests will be on hold,
  but they will be persistently stored.
</p>
<p>
  When in temporary device ID mode, method calls for presenting feedback widgets
  and updating remote config will be ignored.
</p>
<p>
  Later, when the real device ID is set using the<span> </span><code>Countly.<span>changeDeviceId</span>(DEVICE_ID, <span>ON_SERVER</span>);</code><span>&nbsp;</span>method,
  all requests which have been kept on hold until that point will start with the
  real device ID.
</p>
<h2>Retrieving the device id</h2>
<p>
  You may want to see what device id Countly is assigning for the specific device.
  For that, you may use the following calls.
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">String usedId = Countly().getCurrentDeviceId();</code></pre>
<h1>Push Notifications</h1>
<p>
  Please first check our
  <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360037270012" target="_self" rel="undefined">Push Notifications documentation</a>
  to see how you can use this feature. Since Android and iOS handles notifications
  differently (from how you can send them externally to how they are handled in
  native code), we need to provide different instructions for these two platforms.
</p>
<h2>General Setup</h2>
<p>
  <span>First, when setting up Push for the React Native (Bridge) SDK, select the push token mode. This allows you to choose either test or production modes. Note that the </span>push
  token mode should be set before initialization. U<span style="font-weight:400">se the method below.</span>
</p>
<pre>// Important: call this method before init method<br>Countly.pushTokenType(Countly.messagingMode.DEVELOPMENT, "Channel Name", "Channel Description");<br>// Countly.messagingMode.DEVELOPMENT<br>// Countly.messagingMode.PRODUCTION<br>// Countly.messagingMode.ADHOC</pre>
<p>
  <span>When you are ready to initialize Countly Push, call <code>Countly.askForNotificationPermission()</code> after <code>init</code>, using the method below.</span>
</p>
<pre>// Call this method any time.<br>Countly.askForNotificationPermission();<br>// This method will ask for permission, <br>// and send push token to countly server.</pre>
<p>
  To register a Push Notification callback after initialising the SDK, use the
  method below.
</p>
<pre>Countly.registerForNotification(function(theNotification){<br>console.log(JSON.stringify(theNotification));<br>});</pre>
<h2>Android Setup</h2>
<p>
  Step 1:
  <span>For FCM credentials setup please follow the instruction from this URL</span><br>
  <a class="c-link" href="https://support.count.ly/hc/en-us/articles/360037754031-Android#getting-fcm-credentials" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://support.count.ly/hc/en-us/articles/360037754031-Android#getting-fcm-credentials" data-sk="tooltip_parent">https://support.count.ly/hc/en-us/articles/360037754031-Android#getting-fcm-credentials</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Step 2: Make sure you have <code>google-services.json</code> from
  <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">https://firebase.google.com/</a>
</p>
<p>
  Step 3: Make sure the app package name and the
  <code>google-services.json</code> <code>package_name</code> matches.
</p>
<p>
  Step 4: Place the <code>google-services.json</code> file inside
  <code>android/app</code>
</p>
<p>
  Step 5: Use google services latest version from this link
  <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/guides/google-services-plugin">https://developers.google.com/android/guides/google-services-plugin</a>
</p>
<p>

<h2>iOS Setup</h2>
<p>
  For iOS push notification please follow the instruction from this URL
  <a href="https://resources.count.ly/docs/countly-sdk-for-ios-and-os-x#section-push-notifications">https://resources.count.ly/docs/countly-sdk-for-ios-and-os-x#section-push-notifications</a>
</p>
<p>
  For React Native you can find <code>CountlyNotificationService.h/m</code> file
  under
  <code>Pods/Development Pods/CountlyReactNative/CountlyNotificationService.h/m</code>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Pro Tips to find the files from deep hierarchy:<br></strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    You can filter the files in the navigator using a shortcut âŒ¥âŒ˜J (Option-Command-J),
    in the filter box type "CountlyNotificationService" and it will show the
    related files only.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>&nbsp;You can find the file using the shortcut</span><span> â‡§âŒ˜O (Shift-Command-O) and then navigate to that file using the shortcut â‡§âŒ˜J (Shift-Command-J)</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You can drag and drop both .h and .m files from Pod to Compile Sources.

<h1>User Location</h1>
<p>
  <span>Countly allows you to send geolocation-based push notifications to your users. By default, the Countly Server uses the GeoIP database to deduce a user's location. </span>
</p>
<h2>Set User Location</h2>
<p>
  <span>If your app has a different way of detecting location, you may send this information to the Countly Server by using the <code>setLocationInit</code>&nbsp;or<code>setLocation</code> methods.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>We recommend using the <code>setLocationInit</code> method before initialization to sent location. This includes:</span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code><span>countryCode</span></code><span>&nbsp;</span>a string in ISO 3166-1
    alpha-2 format country code
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>city</code><span>&nbsp;</span>a string specifying city name
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>location</code><span>&nbsp;</span>a string comma-separated latitude
    and longitude
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>IP</code><span>&nbsp;</span>a string specifying an IP address in IPv4
    or IPv6 formats
  </li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="javascript">// Example for setLocationInit
var countryCode = "us";
var city = "Houston";
var latitude = "29.634933";
var longitude = "-95.220255";
var ipAddress = "103.238.105.167";

Countly.setLocationInit(countryCode, city, latitude + "," + longitude, ipAddress);</code></pre>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400"><span>Geolocation recording methods may also be called at any time after the Countly SDK has started.<br>To do so, use the <code>setLocation</code> method as shown below.</span></span><span style="font-weight:400"></span>
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">// Example for setLocation
var countryCode = "us";
var city = "Houston";
var latitude = "29.634933";
var longitude = "-95.220255";
var ipAddress = "103.238.105.167";

Countly.setLocation(countryCode, city, latitude + "," + longitude, ipAddress);
</code></pre>
<h2>Disable Location</h2>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">To erase any cached location data from the device and stop further location tracking, use the following method. Note that i</span><span style="font-weight:400">f after disabling location, the <code>setLocation</code></span><span style="font-weight:400">is called with any non-null value, tracking will resume.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">//disable location tracking
Countly.disableLocation();</code></pre>
<h1>Remote Config</h1>
<p>
  <span>Remote config allows you to modify how your app functions or looks by requesting key-value pairs from your Countly server. The returned values may be modified based on the user profile. For more details, please see the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://resources.count.ly/docs/remote-config"><span>Remote Config documentation</span></a><span>.</span>
</p>
<h2>Manual Remote Config download</h2>
<p>
  <span>There are three ways for manually requesting a remote config update:</span><span></span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span>&nbsp;Manually updating everything</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>Manually updating specific keys</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>Manually updating everything except specific keys.</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <span>Each of these requests also has a callback. If the callback returns a non-null value, the request will encounter an error and fail.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The <code>remoteConfigUpdate</code></span><span>&nbsp;replaces all stored values with the ones from the server (all locally stored values are deleted and replaced with new ones). The advantage is that you can make the request whenever it is desirable for you. It has a callback to let you know when it has finished.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">Countly.remoteConfigUpdate(function(data){<br>console.log(data);<br>});</code></pre>
<p>
  <span>Or you might only want to update specific key values. To do so, you will need to call&nbsp;<code>updateRemoteConfigForKeysOnly</code></span><span>&nbsp;with the list of keys you would like to be updated. That list is an array with the string values of those keys. It has a callback to let you know when the request has finished.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">Countly.updateRemoteConfigForKeysOnly(){<br>Countly.updateRemoteConfigForKeysOnly(["aa", "bb"],function(data){<br>console.log(data);<br>});</code></pre>
<p>
  <span>Or you might want to update all the values except a few defined keys. To do so,&nbsp; call&nbsp;<code>updateRemoteConfigExceptKeys</code></span><span>. The key list is an array with string values of the keys. It has a callback to let you know when the request has finished.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">Countly.updateRemoteConfigExceptKeys(["aa", "bb"],function(data){<br>console.log(data);<br>});</code></pre>
<p>
  <span>When making requests with an "inclusion" or "exclusion" array, if those arrays are empty or null, they will function the same as a simple manual request and will update all the values. This means it will also erase all keys not returned by the server.</span>
</p>
<h2>Getting Remote Config values</h2>
<p>
  To request a stored value, call<span>&nbsp;</span><code>getRemoteConfigValueForKey</code>
  or&nbsp; <code>getRemoteConfigValueForKeyP</code> with the specified key.
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">Countly.getRemoteConfigValueForKey("KeyName", function(data){<br>console.log(data);<br>});<br><br>var data = await Countly.getRemoteConfigValueForKeyP("KeyName");</code></pre>
<h2>Clearing Stored Remote Config values</h2>
<p>
  <span>At some point, you might like to erase all the values downloaded from the server. You will need to call one function to do so.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">Countly.remoteConfigClearValues();</code></pre>
<h1>User feedback</h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">There are a different ways of receiving feedback from your users: the Star-rating dialog, the Ratings widget, and the Surveys widgets (Surveys and NPSÂ®).</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">The Star-rating dialog allows users to give feedback as a rating from 1 to 5. The Ratings widget allows users to rate using the same 1 to 5 emoji-based rating system as well as leave a text comment. The Surveys widgets (Surveys and NPSÂ®) allow for even more targeted feedback from users.</span>
</p>
<h2>Star rating dialog</h2>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">The Star-rating integration provides a dialog for getting user feedback about an application. It contains a title, a simple message explaining its purpose, a 1 through 5-star meter for getting users rating, and a dismiss button in case the user does not want to give a rating.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">This star rating has nothing to do with Google Play Store ratings and reviews. It is simply for getting brief feedback from your users to be displayed on the Countly dashboard. If the user dismisses the star-rating dialog without giving a rating, the event will not be recorded.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">Countly.showStarRating();</code></pre>
<p>
  The star-rating dialog's title, message, and dismiss button text may be customized
  either through the <code>init</code> function or the&nbsp;<code>SetStarRatingDialogTexts</code>
  function.&nbsp;
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">Countly.SetStarRatingDialogTexts("Custom title", "Custom message", "Custom dismiss button text");</code></pre>
<h2>Rating widget</h2>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">The rating widget displays a server-configured widget to your user devices.</span>
</p>
<div class="img-container">
  <img src="https://count.ly/images/guide/ea55d24-072bb00-t1.png">
</div>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">All the text fields in the example above can be configured and replaced with a custom string of your choice.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">In addition to a 1 through 5 rating, it is possible for users to leave a text comment and an email, should the user like to be contacted by the app developer.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">Showing the rating widget in a single call involves a two-set process: b</span><span style="font-weight:400">efore it is shown, the SDK tries to contact the server to get more information about the dialog. Therefore, a network connection to it is needed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">To display the widget after initializing the SDK, you will first need to get the widget ID from your server, as shown below.</span>
</p>
<div class="img-container">
  <img src="https://count.ly/images/guide/f773cf4-2dd58c6-t2.png">
</div>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">Then, call the function to show the widget popup using the widget ID below.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">Countly.showFeedbackPopup("WidgetId", "Button Text");</code></pre>
<h2>Feedback widget</h2>
<p>
  It is possible to display 2 kinds of Surveys widgets:
  <a href="https://support.count.ly/hc/en-us/articles/900003407386-NPS-Net-Promoter-Score-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPS</a>
  and
  <a href="https://support.count.ly/hc/en-us/articles/900004337763-Surveys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Surveys</a>.
  Both widgets are shown as webviews and they&nbsp;both use the same code methods.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Before any Surveys widget can be shown, you need to create them in your Countly
  Dashboard.
</p>
<p>
  When the widgets are created, you need to use 2 calls in your SDK: one to get
  all available widgets for a user and another to display a chosen widget.
</p>
<p>To get your available widget list, use the call below.</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">Countly.getAvailableFeedbackWidgets().then((retrivedWidgets) =&gt; {<br>},(err) =&gt; {<br>});</code></pre>
<p>
  From the callback, get the list of all available widgets that apply to the current
  device ID.
</p>
<p>The objects in the returned list look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">{ "WIDGET_TYPE" : "WIDGET_ID" }</code></pre>
<p>
  To determine what kind of widget that is, check the "type" value. The potential
  values are <code>survey</code> and <code>nps</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Then use the widget type and description (which is the same as provided in the
  Dashboard) to decide which widget to show.
</p>
<p>
  After you have decided which widget you want to display, call the function below.
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">Countly.presentFeedbackWidget("WIDGET_TYPE", "WIDGET_ID", "CLOSE_BUTTON_TEXT");</code></pre>
<h1>User Profiles</h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">You can provide Countly any details you may have about your user or visitor. This will allow you to track each specific user on the "User Profiles" tab, which is available in Countly Enterprise Edition. For more details, please review the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360037630571" target="_self" rel="undefined">User Profiles documentation</a>.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">In order to set a user profile, use the code snippet below. After you send a userâ€™s data, it can be found in your Dashboard under <code>Users &gt; User Profiles</code>.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">// Example for setting user data
var options = {};
options.name = "Nicola Tesla";
options.username = "nicola";
options.email = "info@nicola.tesla";

options.picture = "http://www.trust.electric/images/people/nicola.png";
options.picturePath = "";
options.gender = "M";
options.byear = 1919;
Countly.setUserData(options);</code></pre>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">Countly also supports custom user properties that you can attach for each user. In order to set or modify a user's data (e.g. increment, multiply, etc.), use the code snippet below.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">// examples for custom user properties
Countly.userData.setProperty("keyName", "keyValue"); //set custom property
Countly.userData.setOnce("keyName", 200); //set custom property only if property does not exist
Countly.userData.increment("keyName"); //increment value in key by one
Countly.userData.incrementBy("keyName", 10); //increment value in key by provided value
Countly.userData.multiply("keyName", 20); //multiply value in key by provided value
Countly.userData.saveMax("keyName", 100); //save max value between current and provided
Countly.userData.saveMin("keyName", 50); //save min value between current and provided
Countly.userData.setOnce("setOnce", 200);//insert value to array of unique values
Countly.userData.pushUniqueValue("type", "morning");//insert value to array of unique values
Countly.userData.pushValue("type", "morning");//insert value to array which can have duplicates
Countly.userData.pullValue("type", "morning");//remove value from array</code></pre>
<h1>Application Performance Monitoring</h1>
<p>
  The Performance Monitoring feature allows you to analyze your application's performance
  on various aspects.
  <span style="font-weight:400">For more details, please review the</span>
  <a href="https://support.count.ly/hc/en-us/articles/900000819806-Performance-monitoring" target="_self">Performance Monitoring documentation</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Here is how you can utilize the Performance Monitoring feature in your apps:
</p>
<p>
  First, you need to enable the Performance Monitoring feature:
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">// Enable APM features.
Countly.enableApm();</code></pre>
<p>
  With this, the Countly SDK will start measuring some performance traces automatically,
  including app foreground time, app background time. Additionally, custom traces
  and network traces can be manually recorded.
</p>
<h2>App Start Time</h2>
<p>
  For the app start time to be recorded, you need to call the<span>&nbsp;</span><code>appLoadingFinished</code><span>&nbsp;</span>method.
  Make sure this method is called after <code>init</code>.
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">// Example of appLoadingFinished
await Countly.init("https://try.count.ly", "YOUR_APP_KEY");<br>Countly.appLoadingFinished();</code></pre>
<p>
  This calculates and records the app launch time for performance monitoring.<br>
  It should be called when the app is loaded and it&nbsp;successfully displayed
  its first user-facing view.&nbsp;E.g. <code>componentDidMount:</code>&nbsp;method
  or wherever is suitable for the app's flow. The time passed since the app has
  started to launch will be automatically calculated and recorded for performance
  monitoring. Note that the app launch time can be recorded only once per app launch.
  So, the second and following calls to this method will be ignored.
</p>
<h2>Custom trace</h2>
<p>
  <span><span class="Apple-converted-space">You may also measure any operation you want and record it using custom traces. First, you need to start a trace by using the <code class="objectivec">startTrace(traceKey)</code> method:</span></span>
</p>
<pre>Countly.<span>startTrace</span>(traceKey);</pre>
<p>
  Then you may end it using the
  <span><span class="Apple-converted-space"><code class="objectivec">endTrace(traceKey, customMetric)</code>method, optionally passing any metrics as key-value pairs:</span></span>
</p>
<pre>String traceKey = <span>"Trace Key"</span>;<br>Map&lt;String, int&gt; customMetric = {<br>  <span>"ABC"</span>: <span>1233</span>,<br>  <span>"C44C"</span>: <span>1337<br></span>};<br>Countly.<span>endTrace</span>(traceKey, customMetric);</pre>
<p>
  The duration of the custom trace will be automatically calculated upon ending.
</p>
<p>
  Trace names should be non-zero length valid strings. Trying to start a custom
  trace with the already started name will have no effect. Trying to end a custom
  trace with already ended (or not yet started) name will have no effect.
</p>
<p>
  You may also cancel any custom trace you started using the<span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <code class="objectivec">cancelTrace(traceKey)</code>method:</span></span>
</p>
<pre>Countly.cancelTrace(traceKey);</pre>
<p>
  Additionally, if you need you may cancel <strong>all</strong> custom traces you
  started, using the
  <span><span class="Apple-converted-space"><code class="objectivec">clearAllTraces()</code>method:</span></span>
</p>
<pre>Countly.clearAllTraces(traceKey);</pre>
<h2>Network trace</h2>
<p>
  You may record manual network traces using the
  <code><span>recordNetworkTrace(networkTraceKey, responseCode, requestPayloadSize, responsePayloadSize, startTime, endTime)</span></code>&nbsp;method.
</p>
<p>
  A network trace is a collection of measured information about a network request.<br>
  When a network request is completed, a network trace can be recorded manually
  to be analyzed via Performance Monitoring later using the following parameters:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  - <code>networkTraceKey</code>: A non-zero length valid string<br>
  - <code>responseCode</code>: HTTP status code of the received response<br>
  - <code>requestPayloadSize</code>: Size of the request's payload in bytes<br>
  - <code>responsePayloadSize</code>: Size of the received response's payload in
  bytes<br>
  - <code>startTime</code>: UNIX timestamp in milliseconds for the starting time
  of the request<br>
  - <code>endTime</code>: UNIX timestamp in milliseconds for the ending time of
  the request
</p>
<pre>Countly.<span>recordNetworkTrace</span>(networkTraceKey, responseCode, requestPayloadSize, responsePayloadSize, startTime, endTime);</pre>
<h1>User consent</h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">Being compliant with GDPR and other data privacy regulations, Countly provides ways to toggle different Countly tracking features on or off depending on a user's given consent. For more details, please review the </span><a href="https://resources.count.ly/docs/compliance-hub"><span style="font-weight:400">Compliance Hub plugin</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">&nbsp;documentation.</span><span style="font-weight:400"><br></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Currently, available features with consent control are as follows</span>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    sessions - tracking when, how often, and how long users use your app
  </li>
  <li>events - allows sending custom events to the server</li>
  <li>views - allows tracking which views user visits</li>

  Countly won't accept any incoming requests.

<h1>Other features</h1>
<h2>Attribution analytics &amp; install campaigns&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://count.ly/attribution-analytics">Countly Attribution Analytics</a>
  allows you to measure the performance of your marketing campaign by attributing
  installs from specific campaigns. This feature is available for the Enterprise
  Edition.
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">For version 20.11.4 and greater we highly recommend allowing Countly to listen to the </span><strong>INSTALL_REFERRER</strong><span style="font-weight:400">&nbsp;intent in order to receive more precise attribution on Android, something you may do by adding the following XML code to your&nbsp;</span><strong>AndroidManifest.xml</strong><span style="font-weight:400">&nbsp;file inside&nbsp;the </span><strong>application</strong><span style="font-weight:400">&nbsp;tag.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="xml">&lt;receiver android:name="ly.count.android.sdk.ReferrerReceiver" android:exported="true"&gt;
	&lt;intent-filter&gt;
		&lt;action android:name="com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER" /&gt;
	&lt;/intent-filter&gt;
&lt;/receiver&gt;</code></pre>

  <strong><span style="font-weight:400">For more information about how to set up your campaigns, please&nbsp;</span><a href="http://resources.count.ly/docs/referral-analytics"><span style="font-weight:400">review this documentation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">.</span></strong>
</p>
<p>Call the method below before initialization.</p>
<pre><span>// Enable to measure your marketing campaign performance by attributing installs from specific campaigns.</span><br>Countly.<span>enableAttribution</span>();</pre>
<p>
  <span>For iOS 14+ use the <code><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Countly</span><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">.</span><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">recordAttributionID("IDFA")</span></code></span><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> function instead of <span><code>Countly.enableAttribution()</code></span></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>You can use <code><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Countly</span><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">.</span><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">recordAttributionID</span></code>&nbsp;function to specify IDFA for campaign attribution</span>
</p>
<pre><span><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Countly</span><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">.</span><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">recordAttributionID("</span>IDFA_VALUE_YOU_GET_FROM_THE_SYSTEM");</span><span></span></pre>
<p>
  <span>For iOS 14+ due to Apple changes regarding Application Tracking, you need to ask the user for permission to track the Application.</span><span></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For IDFA you can use this Plugin, which also supports iOS 14+ changes for Application tracking permission:<br></span><span><a href="https://github.com/ijunaid/react-native-advertising-id.git">https://github.com/ijunaid/react-native-advertising-id.git</a></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Here is how to use this plugin with the Countly attribution feature:</span>
</p>
<div>
  <pre>npm install --save <a href="https://github.com/ijunaid/react-native-advertising-id.git">https://github.com/ijunaid/react-native-advertising-id.git</a><br><br>cd ./ios<br>pod install<br><br><strong>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</strong><br>Add "Privacy - Tracking Usage Description" in your ios info.plist file.<br><br><strong>#Example Code for Countly attribution feature to support iOS 14+.</strong><br><br>import RNAdvertisingId from 'react-native-advertising-id';<br><br>if (Platform.OS.match("ios")) {<br>RNAdvertisingId.getAdvertisingId()<br>.then(response =&gt; {<br>Countly.recordAttributionID(response.advertisingId);<br>})<br>.catch(error =&gt; console.error(error));<br>}<br>else {<br>Countly.enableAttribution(); // Enable to measure your marketing campaign performance by attributing installs from specific campaigns.<br>}</pre>
</div>
<h2>Forcing HTTP POST</h2>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">If the data sent to the server is short enough, the SDK will use HTTP GET requests. In the event you would like an override so that HTTP POST may be used in all cases, call the <code>setHttpPostForced</code> function after you have called <code>init</code>. You may use the same function later in the appâ€™s life cycle to disable the override. This function has to be called every time the app starts, using the method below.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">  
// enabling the override
Countly.setHttpPostForced(true);
  
// disabling the override
Countly.setHttpPostForced(false);</code></pre>
<h2>Checking if init has been called</h2>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">In the event you would like to check if init has been called, use the function below.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">Countly.isInitialized().then(result =&gt; console.log(result)); // true or false
</code></pre>
<h2>Checking if onStart has been called</h2>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight:400">For some applications, there might be a use case where the developer would like to check if the Countly SDK onStart function has been called. To do so, use the call below.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">Countly.hasBeenCalledOnStart().then(result =&gt; console.log(result)); // true or false </code></pre>
<h2>Interacting with the internal request queue</h2>
<p>
  When recording events or activities, the requests don't always get sent immediately.
  Events get grouped together. All the requests contain the same app key which
  is provided in the <code>init</code> function.
</p>
<p>
  There are two ways to interact with the app key in the request queue at the moment.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  1. You can replace all requests with a different app key with the current app
  key:&nbsp;
</p>
<pre>//Replaces all requests with a different app key with the current app key.<br>Countly.replaceAllAppKeysInQueueWithCurrentAppKey();</pre>
<p>
  In the request queue, if there are any requests whose app key is different than
  the current app key, these requests app key will be replaced with the current
  app key.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">2. You can remove all requests with a different app key in the request queue:</span>
</p>
<pre><span>//Removes all requests with a different app key in request queue.<br></span>Countly.removeDifferentAppKeysFromQueue();</pre>
<p>
  <span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In the request queue, if there are any requests whose app key is different than the current app key, these requests will be removed from the request queue.</span>
</p>
<h2>Setting an event queue threshold</h2>
<p>
  Events get grouped together and are sent either every minute or after the unsent
  event count reaches a threshold. By default it is 10. If you would like to change
  this, call:
</p>
<pre>Countly.setEventSendThreshold(<span>6</span>);</pre>
