<p>
  <span>This document will guide you through the process of SDK installation and it applies to version 21.11.1. </span>
</p>
<p>
  It is an open-source SDK, you can take a look at our SDK code in the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-cpp/" target="_self" rel="undefined">Github repo</a>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Supported Platforms:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Windows, GNU/Linux, and
  <span>Mac OS X</span>.
</p>
<h1>
  <span>Adding the SDK to the project</span>
</h1>
<p dir="auto">
  Countly C++ SDK has been designed to work with very few dependencies in order
  to be available on most platforms. In order to build this SDK, you need:
</p>
<ul dir="auto">
  <li>a C++ compiler with C++11 support</li>
  <li>libcurl (with openssl) and its headers if you are on *nix</li>
  <li>cmake &gt;= 3.13</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">First, clone the repository with its submodules:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative overflow-auto">
  <pre>git clone --recursive https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-cpp</pre>
</div>
<p dir="auto">
  If you want to use SQLite to store session data persistently, build sqlite:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative overflow-auto">
  <pre><span class="pl-c"># assuming we are on project root</span>
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> vendor/sqlite
cmake -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=1 -B build <span class="pl-c1">.</span> <span class="pl-c"># out of source build, we don't like clutter :)</span>
<span class="pl-c"># we define `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` because sqlite's cmake file compiles statically by default for some reason</span>
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> build
make <span class="pl-c"># you might want to add something like -j8 to parallelize the build process</span></pre>
</div>
<p dir="auto">The cmake build flow is pretty straightforward:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative overflow-auto">
  <pre><span class="pl-c"># assuming we are on project root again</span>
cmake -B build <span class="pl-c1">.</span> <span class="pl-c"># this will launch a TUI, configure the build as you see fit</span>
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> build
make</pre>
  <p dir="auto">
    Build with the option<code>COUNTLY_BUILD_TESTS</code><span> and <code>COUNTLY_BUILD_SAMPLE</code></span><strong>ON</strong>
    to build executables to run the tests and sample app.
  </p>
  <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative overflow-auto">
    <pre>cmake -DCOUNTLY_BUILD_SAMPLE=1 -DCOUNTLY_BUILD_TESTS=1 -B build <span class="pl-c1">.</span> <span class="pl-c"># or do it interactively with cmake</span>
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> build
make ./countly-tests   # run unit test<br>make ./countly-sample  # run sample app</pre>
  </div>
</div>
<h1>SDK Integration</h1>
<h2>Minimal Setup</h2>
<p>
  Before you can use any functionality, you have to initiate the SDK.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The shortest way to initiate the SDK is with this code snippet:
</p>
<pre><span><code>Countly&amp; countly = <span class="pl-c1">Countly::getInstance</span>();<br>countly.<span class="pl-c1">setDeviceID</span>(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>test-device-id<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>);<br>countly.s<span class="pl-c1">tart</span>(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>YOUR_APP_KEY<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>https://try.count.ly<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>, <span class="pl-c1">443, true</span>);</code></span></pre>
<p>
  It is there that you provide your appKey, and your Countly server URL. For more
  information on how to acquire you application key (appKey) and server URL, check
  <a href="https://support.count.ly/hc/en-us/articles/900000908046-Getting-started-with-SDKs#acquiring-your-application-key-and-server-url%E2%80%9D" target="_self">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The third parameter with type<code>int</code> is a virtual port number and it
  is an optional parameter with a default value of <strong>-1</strong>.<br>
  The last <code>bool</code>parameter is also optional with a default value
  <code>false</code>. When you set this <code>true</code>SDK automatically
  <span>extends the session after every 60 seconds.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<h2 id="enabling-logging" class="anchor-heading">SDK logging mode</h2>
<p>
  <span>The first thing you should do while integrating our SDK is enable logging. If logging is enabled, then our SDK will print out debug messages about its internal state and encounter problems.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
  Set
  <code><span class="pl-c1">setLogger</span><span>(logger_function)</span></code>
  on the <code><span class="pl-c1">Counlty</span></code>&nbsp;object to enable
  logging:
</p>
<pre><span class="pl-c1"><span class="pl-k"><code>void<span> </span><span class="pl-en">printLog</span><span>(Countly::LogLevel level, </span>const<span> string&amp; msg) {...}<br></span>...<br><br>void<span> (*logger_function)(Countly::LogLevel level, </span>const<span> std::string&amp; message);</span><br><span>logger_function = printLog;</span><br><span>Countly::getInstance().setLogger(logger_function);</span></code></span></span></pre>
<h2 id="device-id" class="anchor-heading">Device ID</h2>
<p>
  <span>All tracked information is tied to a "device ID". A device ID is a unique identifier for your users.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>You have to specify the device ID by yourself (it has to be unique for each of your users). It may be an email or some other internal ID used by your other systems.</span>
</p>
<div>
  <pre><span><code><span class="pl-c1">Countly::getInstance().setDeviceID("UNIQUE_DEVICE_ID");</span></code></span></pre>
</div>
<h2 class="c-message_attachment__row">SDK notes</h2>
<p>
  To access the Countly Global Instance use the following code snippet:
</p>
<pre><code><span class="pl-c1">Countly::getInstance<span>().</span></span></code></pre>
<h1>Events</h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><a href="http://resources.count.ly/docs/custom-events"><span style="font-weight: 400;">event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is any type of action that you can send to a Countly instance, e.g. purchases, changed settings, view enabled, and so on, letting you get valuable information about your application.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There are a couple of values that can be set when recording an event. The main one is the <strong>key</strong> property which would be the identifier/name for that event.&nbsp; For example, in case a user purchased an item in a game, you could create an event with the key 'purchase'.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Optionally there are also other properties that you might want to set:</span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>count -</strong>&nbsp; a whole numerical value that marks how many
    times this event has happened. The default value for that is
    <strong>1</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>sum -</strong> This value would be summed across all events in the
    dashboard. F<span>or example, in-app purchase events sum of purchased items. Its default value is <strong>0</strong>.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>duration - </strong>Used to record and track the duration of events.
    The default value is <strong>0</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>segments - </strong>A value where you can provide custom segmentation
    for your events to track additional information. It is a key and value map.
    The accepted data type for the value is<span style="font-weight: 400;"><code class="java"><span>std::string</span></code>.</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Recording events</h2>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the example below of an event recording a <strong>purchase</strong>, h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ere is a quick summary of the information for each usage:</span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Usage 1: how many times the&nbsp;<strong>purchase</strong> event occurred.
  </li>
  <li>
    Usage 2: how many times the&nbsp;<strong>purchase</strong> event occurred
    + the total amount of those purchases.
  </li>
  <li>
    Usage 3: how many times the&nbsp;<strong>purchase</strong> event occurred
    +
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">from which countries and application versions those purchases were made.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Usage 4: how many times the&nbsp;<strong>purchase</strong> event occurred
    +&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">the total amount, both of which are also available, segmented into countries and application versions.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Usage 5: how many times the&nbsp;<strong>purchase</strong> event occurred
    +
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">the total amount, both of which are also available, segmented by countries and application versions + the total duration of those events.</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>1. Event key and count</strong>
</p>
<pre><code class="java"><span class="pl-c1">Countly::getInstance</span><span>()</span>.<span>RecordEvent</span>("purchase", 1);</code></pre>
<p>
  <strong>2. Event key, count, and sum</strong>
</p>
<pre><code class="java"><span class="pl-c1">Countly::getInstance</span><span>()</span>.<span>RecordEvent</span>("purchase", 1, 0.99);</code></pre>
<p>
  <strong>3. Event key and count with segmentation(s)</strong>
</p>
<pre><code class="java">std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt; segmentation;<br>segmentation["country"] = "Germany";<br><br><span class="pl-c1">Countly::getInstance</span><span>()</span>.<span>RecordEvent</span>("purchase", segmentation, 1);<br></code></pre>
<p>
  <strong>4. Event key, count, and sum with segmentation(s)</strong>
</p>
<pre><code class="java">std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt; segmentation;<br>segmentation["country"] = "Germany";<br><br><span class="pl-c1">Countly::getInstance</span><span>()</span>.<span>RecordEvent</span>("purchase", segmentation, 1, 0.99);</code></pre>
<p>
  <strong>5. Event key, count, sum, and duration with segmentation(s)</strong>
</p>
<pre><code class="java">std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt; segmentation;<br>segmentation["country"] = "Germany";<br><br><span class="pl-c1">Countly::getInstance</span><span>()</span>.<span>RecordEvent</span>("purchase", segmentation, 1, 0.99, 60.0);<br></code></pre>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">These are only a few examples of what you can do with Events. You may go beyond those examples and use country, app_version, game_level, time_of_day, and any other segmentation of your choice that will provide you with valuable insights.</span>
</p>
<h2>Timed events</h2>
<p>
  <span>It's possible to create timed events by defining a start and a stop moment.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">Event event("Some event", 1);</code><br><span class="hljs-comment"><br>//start some event</span><br><code class="java hljs">event.startTimer();<br></code><span class="hljs-comment">//wait some time<br><br></span><span class="hljs-comment">//end the timer and record event</span><br><code class="java hljs">event.stopTimer();<br>
Countly.getInstance().addEvent(event);</code></pre>
<p>
  <span>You may also provide additional information e.g segmentation, count, and sum.</span>
</p>
<pre><span class="hljs-comment">//event with count and sum</span>
<code class="java hljs">Event event("Some event", 1, 0.99);</code><br><span class="hljs-comment">//add segmentation to event</span><br><code class="java hljs">event.addSegmentation("country", "Germany");</code><br>...<br><br><code class="java hljs">Countly.getInstance().addEvent(event);</code></pre>
<h1>Sessions</h1>
<h2 id="automatic-session-tracking&nbsp;" class="anchor-heading">
  <span>Automatic session tracking&nbsp;</span>
</h2>
<p>
  The SDK handles the session automatically. After calling the&nbsp;<span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><code class="java">s<span class="pl-c1">tart</span>(...)</code></span> </span>method,
  the SDK starts the session automatically and extends the session after every
  60 seconds. This value is configurable during and after initialization.&nbsp;<br>
  Example:
</p>
<pre><span style="font-weight: 400;"><code class="java"><span class="pl-c1">Countly::getInstance</span><span>()</span>.setAutomaticSessionUpdateInterval(10);<span></span></code></span></pre>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>The SDK ends the current session whenever the user quits the app.</span></span>
</p>
<h1 id="device-id-management" class="anchor-heading" tabindex="-1">Device ID management</h1>
<p>
  <span>A device ID is a unique identifier for your users.&nbsp;</span><span>You have to specify the device ID yourself. When providing one yourself, keep in mind that it has to be unique for all users. Some potential sources for such an id may be the user's username, email, or some other internal ID used by your other systems.</span><span></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In the C++ SDK the device ID is not persistant and has to be provided every time you start the SDK.</span>
</p>
<h2 id="changing-device-id" class="anchor-heading">Changing device ID</h2>
<p>
  <span>In case your application authenticates users, you might want to change the ID to the one in your backend after he has logged in. This helps you identify a specific user with a specific ID on a device he logs in, and the same scenario can also be used in cases this user logs in using a different way (e.g another tablet, another mobile phone, or web). In this case, any data stored in your Countly server database associated with the current device ID will be transferred (merged) into the user profile with the device id you specified in the following method call:</span>
</p>
<pre><span style="font-weight: 400;"><code class="java"><span class="pl-c1">Countly::getInstance</span><span>().setDeviceID("new-device-id", true);</span></code></span></pre>
<p>
  <span>You might want to track information about another separate user that starts using your app (changing apps account), or your app enters a state where you no longer can verify the identity of the current user (user logs out). In that case, you can change the current device ID to a new one without merging their data. You would call:</span>
</p>
<pre><span style="font-weight: 400;"><code class="java"><span class="pl-c1">Countly::getInstance</span><span>().setDeviceID("new-device-id", false);</span></code></span></pre>
<p>
  <span>Doing it this way, will not merge the previously acquired data with the new id.</span><span></span><span></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If the second parameter<code>same_user</code>is set to&nbsp;<code>true</code>, the old device ID on the server will be replaced with the new one, and data associated with the old device ID will be merged automatically.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Otherwise, if <code>same_user</code>&nbsp;bool is set to&nbsp;<code>false</code>, the device will be counted as a new device on the server.</span>
</p>
<h1 id="user-location" class="anchor-heading garden-focus-visible" tabindex="-1" data-garden-focus-visible="true">
  <span>User location</span>
</h1>
<p>
  <span>While integrating this SDK into your application, you might want to track your user location. You could use this information to better know your app’s user base. There are 4 fields that can be provided:</span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span>Country code (two-letter ISO standard).</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>City name (must be set together with the country code).</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>Latitude and longitude values, separated by a comma e.g.</span><span>&nbsp;</span>"56.42345,123.45325".
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>Your user’s IP address.</span><span></span>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-location" class="anchor-heading">Setting location</h2>
<p>
  <span>During init, you may </span><span>set location, and </span><span>after SDK initialization, this location info will be sent to the server at the start of the user session.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Example:</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs cs"><span><span class="hljs-keyword">string</span> countryCode = </span><span class="hljs-string">"us"</span><span>;<br><span class="hljs-keyword">string</span> city = </span><span class="hljs-string">"Houston"</span><span>;<br><span class="hljs-keyword">string</span> latitude = </span><span class="hljs-string">"29.634933"</span><span>; <br><span class="hljs-keyword">string</span> longitude = </span><span class="hljs-string">"-95.220255"</span><span>; <br><span class="hljs-keyword">string</span> ipAddress = "192.168.0.1"</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<br><br><span>Countly::getInstance()</span>.s<span>etLocation</span>(<span>countryCode, city, latitude + </span><span class="hljs-string">","</span><span> + longitude, ipAddress</span>);</code></pre>
<p>
  <span>Note that the IP address will only be updated if set through the init process.</span>
</p>
<p>
  When those values are set a<span>fter SDK initialization</span>, a separate request
  will be created to send them. Except for IP address, because Countly server processes
  IP address only when starting a session.
</p>
<p>
  If you don't want to set specific fields, set them to empty.
</p>
<h1 id="remote-config" class="anchor-heading" tabindex="-1">Remote config</h1>
<p>
  <span>Available in the Enterprise Edition, Remote Config allows you to modify how your app functions or looks by requesting key-value pairs from your Countly server. The returned values may be modified based on the user profile. For more details, please see the </span><a href="https://resources.count.ly/docs/remote-config"><span>Remote Config documentation</span></a><span>.</span>
</p>
<h2 id="manual-remote-config-download" class="anchor-heading">Manual remote config</h2>
<p>
  To download Remote Config, call <code>updateRemoteConfig()</code>.&nbsp;
</p>
<pre><code>Countly.<span>getInstance</span>().updateRemoteConfig();</code></pre>
<h2>Accessing remote config values</h2>
<p>
  To access the stored config,&nbsp; call
  <code>Countly.getInstance().getRemoteConfigValue(const std::string&amp; key)</code>.
  It will return <code>null</code> if there isn't any config stored.
</p>
<pre><code>Countly.getInstance().getRemoteConfigValue("Key");</code></pre>
<p>
  <span>It returns a value of the type <code>json</code></span><span>.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<h1>User profiles</h1>
<p>
  <span>For information about User Profiles, review </span><a href="http://resources.count.ly/docs/user-profiles"><span>this documentation</span></a><span>.</span>
</p>
<h2>Setting predefined values</h2>
<p>
  The Countly C++ SDK allows you to upload specific data related to a user to the
  Countly server. You may set the data against predefined keys for a particular
  user.
</p>
<p>The keys for predefined user data fields are as follows:</p>
<div class="table-container">

<p>
  The SDK allows you to upload user details using the methods listed below.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt; userdetail = { <br>{"name", "Full name"}, <br>{"username", "username123"},<br>{"email", "useremail@email.com"},<br>{"phone", "222-222-222"},<br>{"picture", "http://webresizer.com/images2/bird1_after.jpg"},<br>{"gender", "M"},<br>{"byear", "1991"},<br>{"organization", "Organization"},<br>};<br>Countly.getInstance().setUserDetails(userdetail);</code></pre>
<h2>Setting custom values</h2>
<p>
  The SDK gives you the flexibility to send only the custom data to Countly servers,
  even when you don’t want to send other user-related data.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt; userdetail = { <br>{"Height", "5.8"}, <br>{"Mole", "Lower Left Cheek"}<br>};<br><br>Countly.getInstance().setCustomUserDetails(userdetail);</code></pre>
<h2>Setting User picture</h2>
<p>
  The SDK allows you to set the user's picture URL along with other details using
  the methods listed below.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>std::map&lt;std::string, std::string&gt; userdetail = { <br>{"name", "Full name"}, <br>{"picture", "http://webresizer.com/images2/bird1_after.jpg"},<br>};<br><br>Counlty.getInstance().setUserDetails(userdetail);</code></pre>
<h1>Security and privacy</h1>
<h2 id="parameter-tampering-protection" class="anchor-heading">Parameter tamper protection</h2>
<p>
  <span>You may set the optional&nbsp;<code>salt</code></span><span>&nbsp;to be used for calculating the checksum of requested data which will be sent with each request, using the&nbsp;<code>&amp;checksum</code></span><span>&nbsp;field. You will need to set exactly the same&nbsp;<code>salt</code></span><span>&nbsp;on the Countly server. If&nbsp;the&nbsp;<code>salt</code></span><span>&nbsp;on the Countly server is set, all requests would be checked for the validity of the&nbsp;<code>&amp;checksum</code></span><span> the field before being processed.</span>
</p>
<pre><code class="java hljs">Countly.getInstance().setSalt("salt");</code></pre>
<h1>Other features</h1>
<h2>Setting event queue threshold</h2>
<p>
  After SDK init, you may limit the number of events that can be recorded internally
  by the system before they can all be sent together in one request.&nbsp;<br>
  Example:
</p>
<pre><code>Counlty.getInstance().SetMaxEventsPerMessage(10);</code></pre>
<p>
  Once the threshold limit is reached, the system groups all recorded events and
  sends them to the server.
</p>
<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>What information is collected by the SDK</h2>
<p>
  The following description mentions data that is collected by SDK to perform their
  functions and implement the required features. Before any of it is sent to the
  server, it is stored locally.
</p>
<p>
  * When sending any network requests to the server, the following things are sent
  in addition to the main data:<br>
  - Timestamp of when the request is created<br>
  - SDK version<br>
  - SDK name
</p>
